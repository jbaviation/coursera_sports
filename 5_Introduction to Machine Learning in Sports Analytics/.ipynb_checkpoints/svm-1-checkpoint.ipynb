    "# Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vector machine is a commonly used approach for engaging in supervised machine learning. In a \n",
    "very basic form, we can think of an SVM model as trying to separate two classes of data which are color coded \n",
    "in two dimensional scatter plot and we want to separate them with a straight line. And the goal is really to \n",
    "find a linear equation that best separates these two classes of data. If we can find an equation that can \n",
    "separate the data cleanly, the the classes are considered to be _linearly separable_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a an example of this, and we're going to go to major leage baseball. I'm going to make the problem\n",
    "a bit easier and cleaner for us for teaching, but we'll see how to deal with some ambiguity later. Now, the MLB\n",
    "captures a lot of data about pitches, though a fair bit of it is actually inferred data so it's a little unclear\n",
    "where each element comes from. But my goal is this: can we use pitching data, sepcifically the speed of the ball \n",
    "and the amount of spin it has when leaving the pitchers hand, and predict the type of pitch it will be? We'll\n",
    "make it even a bit easier, and consider just fastballs and cuveballs, and we'll see if this is a problem which\n",
    "is something that is linearly seperable."

    "Ok, this looks like something which is almost linearly separable! You can see that by reducing it to just these two classes of pitches we get one cluster which is high speed and we have another class of pitches which is lower speed (off speed). Usually we're interested in building models with many more features than two, but two dimensional plots make for a good demonstration. Perhaps confusing at first, I'll more formally denote each feature with a subscript, such as $x_1$ and $x_2$, and I'll describe the set of all features as the variable $X$. You don't have to use this notation, but it's common and will be used in the documentation for most machine learning libraries, including _sklearn_. At the same time, it's common to use the variable $\\hat y$ to represent the output variable we are trying to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember, the goal of the SVM classifier is to find the optimal line, which in the more general terms we call a _hyperplane_, to distinguish between our data classes across all in $X$. This line is called the maximum or _large margin classifier_, and is thought of as a linear band which separates the two classes. This band is sometimes called a street, and the edges of the street are given by parallel lines which exist at the first points from each class which are closest to the line. These points are called the _support vectors_ and that's where SVMs get their name from."

The hyperplane then shifts and changes slope to better distinguish between these two feature sets. But this is just the basics of the SVM, there's a bit more we should consider when building these kinds of models, so let's dive into that in the next lecture."
