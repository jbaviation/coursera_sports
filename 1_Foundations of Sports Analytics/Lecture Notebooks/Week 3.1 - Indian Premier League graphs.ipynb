    "# Visualizing Sports Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we introduced some simple ways to graph data. This week we introduce some more applications of visualization methods in Python. There are entire courses on data visualization methods in Python or R, so here we will only skim the surface. Our object is to show how powerful graphs can be as tools for understanding sports data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, any data analysis should start with drawing some graphs. Literally *looking* at the relationship between variables in your data can help you in a number of different ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying the correlation between variables\n",
    "2. Identifying particular ranges of values where the relationship might change\n",
    "3. Identifying outliers which may not conform to a typical pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, all data analysis is about looking for patterns, and using a visual representation is an especially good way for humans to recognize patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this week we will look at data from four different sports: baseball, basketball, hockey, but first, cricket."

    "## Cricket\n",
    "\n",
    "Cricket is a sport which originated in England several hundred years ago- records of games date back over three hundred years. It is the most popular game in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka - home to almost one quarter of the world's population. It is also a popular sport in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the islands of the Caribbean. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bat and ball game that bears some resemblance to baseball: a ball is thrown by a player (called the bowler in cricket) on one team at a player (called the batsman) on the other team, who attempts to hit it in order to score runs. (Note: although women's cricket is popular and has a long history, the term \"batsman\" is used for men and women alike). A batsman is \"out\" if he hits the ball and it is caught on the fly, and is also \"out\" if the ball hits the \"wicket\", which is a little like the strike-zone in baseball, except that the wicket is a physical object comprising three sticks planted vertically (the \"stumps\") with two smaller sticks resting on top (the \"bails\"). Unlike baseball, a player does not get three strikes before being out- if the wicket is hit and a bail dislodged, the batsman is out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Runs are also simpler in cricket- to complete a run a batsman has to be able to reach the \"crease\" at the \"other end\", which refers to the place from which the bowler delivered the ball, and where there stands another wicket (stumps and bails). At that other end stands another batsman- there are always two at any one time - and that batsman must also run to the opposite crease for the run to be complete. If any fielder can dislodge a bail at the end to which a batsman is running before the batsman reaches the crease then no run is scored and, more importantly, the batsman is out (this, again, is similar to baseball). \n",
    "\n",
    "To score runs the batsman needs to hit the ball to locations which are not close to fielders, to give the batsmen time to complete a run. Depending on where the ball is hit, the batsmen may have time to complete one, two runs, or even three. The game is played on an oval shaped field, and if the ball reaches the designated boundary of the field, four runs are scored, unless the ball crosses the boundary without hitting the ground (like a home run) in which case six runs are awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important differences between baseball and cricket are that (a) there are fewer outs in a game and (b) many more runs are typically scored. A game of cricket is typically played with one or two innings per team. We are going to look at data from the Indian Premier League, which is played under the \"Twenty20\" (T20) rules, in which each team gets only one inning. So each player may bat only once. There are 11 players on each team, and once ten batsmen are \"out\", the innings is over. \n",
    "\n",
    "The higher rate of scoring runs arises because (i) the bat in cricket is larger, and hence hitting the ball is easier (the ball is of similar size, and the distance between bowler and batsman is roughly the same as between pitcher and batter in baseball- the speed of delivery is tyically a bit faster in baseball) (ii) there is no obligation to run when the ball is hit, and there is no rule of three strikes and out - so that a player may stand and bat without attmempting to score runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "T20 cricket was invented in the early 2000s, and is a game played at a fast pace over short period of time (contrary to the popular perception of cricket). In a T20 game each side faces a maximum of 120 balls, and the game is usually completed within three hours (if ten batsmen are out before 120 balls have been bowled, then the innings is over).\n",
    "\n",
    "The team with the highest runs score wins. Statistically speaking, one other critical difference from baseball is that if the team batting second wins, there is no way of knowing how may runs that team could have scored in a completed inning- it is sufficient to outscore the team batting first for the game to be over. You will recall from week 1 that the Pythagorean expectation model fitted the cricket data poorly - and this may be in part due to the fact that the maximum potential score of the team in such cases is unknown."

    "## The Indian Premier League\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indian Premier League (IPL) was founded in 2008 and is the most popular cricket competition in world, and the value of braodcasting rights is estimated to be over $1 billion. The league currently consists of eight franchises based in Indian cities, and the league typically plays over seven weeks in April and May, with every team playing every other team home and away, followed by playoffs involving the top four teams. The season consists of 60 games in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the world's best players are recruited for the IPL. Each season there is a player auction, and teams are subject to a salary cap."

    "## The Run Chase\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which teams bat is decided by the toss of a coin at the start of the game. Teams generally elect to field first (over 80% of the time in our data). Batting with the knowledge of the total you need to reach, having seen the batting conditions (the weather can play a significant role) is a big advantage. There is a fundamental trade-off between batting aggressively, (allowing you to score runs quickly) and batting conservatively (which means that \"outs\" are less likely). The ten wickets (outs) allowed for each team essentially represent resources at the batting team's commands. However, as in baseball, the bowlers tend to be less skilled in batting, and the better batsmen typically play at the top of the innings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Batting is typically hardest at the beginning of an innings, because the bowlers are freshest and the ball is new (unlike baseball, the same ball is used throughout a whole inning). However, there are also fielding restrictions, known as powerplays, which make it easier to make big hits safely, especially during the first ten overs of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "From all this, it should be clear that managing the pace of an innings is a crucial team skill in cricket. We are going to use the IPL data to compare visually the run/wicket profiles of teams in each game."

    "Runs scored determine the outcome of the game, so we will begin by looking at runs totals for each game from the IPL 2018 season and generating charts to show variations in runs scored depending on (a) which team batted first and (b) which team won the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then turn to a particular game - first game of the 2018 season between the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, and compare the progress of each team in terms of runs scored and wickets lost. \n",

The two main differences are that the scores for innings2 seem truncated around the 200-215 mark. That is probably a result of the run chase effect - teams batting second either reach the required target and stop, or the target set in the first place was so high that the team batting second collapsed with a very low score.

    "Bowling in cricket alternates between each end of the batting strip (also, confusingly, called the \"wicket\"). Thus one bowler delivers six consecutive balls from one end, and then another bowler delivers six consecutive balls from the other end. Each batch of six balls (\"deliveries\") is called an \"over\". Hence a Twenty20 game refers to 20 over, equal to 120 deliveries. In the dataframe \"ball_no\" refers to the ball of the over in question, which is referred to by \"over_no\". \"delivery_no\" refers to its position in the inning as a whole. You can see that, in fact, there were 122 deliveries in the Mumbai innings, while there were 124 deliveries in the Chennai innings, despite only 19.5 overs being completed (Chennai won, i.e. surpassed the Mumbai score, with one ball to spare). This arises because some balls delivered do not count- these could be either \"wides\" - called when the umpire decides that the ball was delivered so far away from the batsman that he had no reasonable chance of hitting it - or \"no balls\", called when the bowler released the ball too close to the batsman (there is a line which the bowler must not overstep).\n",

    "Runs_total_end refers to the number of runs scored by each team by the completion of a given delivery number. So we can now draw a linechart plotting the runs against delivery number for Mumbai, the team which batted first:"

    "Now we can see why Chennai fell behind after the initial good start. Unlike Mumbai, Chennai's wickets fell steadily throughout the innings, a fact which tended to slow down the scoring rate. In fact, Chennai had lost eight wickets before its final accleration around the 100 delivery mark. In cricketing terms this was a fairly exceptional performance, for it is unusual for teams that have already lost eight wickets to score many runs, let alone outperform outpace the rest of the innings to this extent.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have shown how a particular kind of visualization can help to understand the performance of teams in cricket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these charts, you start to think about ways to explain outcomes. For example, it seems clear that the rate at which runs are scored is a function of the number of wickets that have fallen, and that the fall of a wicket generally slows the run rate. Likewise, winning teams seem to enjoy periods of rapid acceleration. These observations should lead you to formulate stories (hypotheses) which can be tested more formally. In that sense, visualizing the data is a stepping stone to a more rigorous statistical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Nobel prize winning economist Sir John Hicks once said that he was never convinced of a theory until he could formalize it in an equation, write it down in plain English and draw a picture. Much the same thing is true for data analytics. However, whereas Hicks worked in an age where only limited amounts of data could be analyzed, and so often the picture was an afterthought, we now have the opportunity to start our analysis by drawing pictures which can sometimes show us clearly what the story is to be told.
